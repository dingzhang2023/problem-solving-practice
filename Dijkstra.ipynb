At this point, it can be asserted that $ \\text{dis}[3] $ is the shortest path length from $ k $ to $ 3 $, and there cannot be any other shorter paths from $ k $ to $ 3 $. Proof by contradiction: Assuming there exists a shorter path, then we must go from $ k $ through a node $ u $, where $ \\text{dis}[u] $ is smaller than $ \\text{dis}[3] $, and then through some edges to reach $ 3 $, obtaining a smaller $ \\text{dis}[3] $. But $ \\text{dis}[3] $ is already the minimum, and there are no negative edge weights in the graph, so $ u $ does not exist, which is contradictory. Therefore, the original proposition holds true, and we obtain the final value of $ \\text{dis}[3] $.\n",
